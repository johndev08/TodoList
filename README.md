📝 Simple Todo List (CRUD) in JavaScript
A beginner-friendly Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) — all data stored in the browser using localStorage.

✨ Features
➕ Add new tasks via an input box and button.

📋 Display all saved tasks on the page.

✏️ Edit existing tasks directly from the list.

🗑️ Delete tasks individually.

💾 Persistent storage with localStorage so tasks remain even after refreshing the page.

🛠️ How It Works
Add Task → Enter text and click "Add" to save it to an array and localStorage.

Display Tasks → A display() function dynamically renders tasks with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.

Edit Task → Click "Edit" to change the task text using a prompt(), then update localStorage.

Delete Task → Click "Delete" to remove the task from the array and update localStorage.
